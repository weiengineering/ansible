Following steps would execute the playbook files on APIC.


1. SSH to toolserver host using provided credentials. (If credentials are not provided Default username is ‘cisco’ and password ‘cisco123’

2. Follow the steps in the below link to install aci-cobra SDK:
 http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/aci/apic/sw/1-x/api/python/install/b_Install_Cisco_APIC_Python_SDK_Standalone.html


2. Do a git clone of "https://github.com/jedelman8/aci-ansible".

3. Create Two New Directories

toolserver:~$ sudo mkdir -p /etc/ansible

toolserver:~$ sudo mkdir -p /usr/share/ansible

4. Move Modules and Config to New Directories

toolserver:~$ sudo mv aci-ansible/files/ansible.cfg /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg

toolserver:~$ sudo mv aci-ansible/library/ /usr/share/ansible/cisco_aci

2. Go to /home/cisco/aci-ansible directory. Edit hosts file and add the list of hosts / device names under switches section.
   Note: device or host names must be added in /etc/hosts file

   Example: vi hosts under /home/cisco/aci-ansible. Then add below contents
     apic1                     # single APIC in system- can also use IP if no DNS or /etc/hosts isn't setup


     [all:vars]
	 user = 'admin'
     pass = 'C!sc0123'
   
   Note: Make sure "apic1" name is added in /etc/hosts and /etc/hosts should contain "APIC_IP  apic1". Replace the IP of the apic with APIC_IP
   
3. Copy the respective playbook scripts to /home/USER/aci-ansible/apic-playbook directory (replace the username with USER). Supppose you want to configure interface, then create a .yml file using vi editor and paste the playbook scripts to it.

4. Save and exit

5. Run "ansible-playbook -i hosts apic-playbook/PLAYBOOK_FILE_NAME.yml"
   Example:
   $ ansible-playbook -i hosts apic-playbook/interface.yml
